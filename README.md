### Useful Jupyter Notebooks / Python codes to Urban Informatics 

As a NYU Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) master degree student I had intense contact with projects related with 
urban problems and data drills using cities Open Data, specially NYC Open Data and City of New Orleans Open Data.

Those are the pieces of code that I have most used during the projects and it's been helping me to be more productive and saving a lot of time specially on data wrangling phase.

The Notebooks/Folders are divided into:

1. Data Wrangling
2. Visualization notebooks (Graphics and Maps)
3. Machine Learning codes applied to urban scenarios
